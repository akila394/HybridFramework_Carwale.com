# HybridFramework_Carwale.com
## PROJECT NAME: Web Automation of Carwale.com

### Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create a Selenium Hybrid automation testing framework and adding scripts to automate Carwale.com, India's leading website for car-related details. The framework will enable efficient and reliable testing of the website's functionalities, ensuring the accuracy and quality of car-related information.

### Key Tasks: 
1. Creating a Hybrid Automation Framework: Develop a hybrid automation framework that combines data-driven and keyword-driven methodologies. This framework will allow for reusable functions and test data, ensuring easy maintenance and scalability.

2. Adding Log Files and Screenshots: Capture log files and screenshots of failed test cases to facilitate debugging and error analysis during test execution.

Support for Multiple Browsers: Configure the framework to run tests on desired browsers, including cross-browser and parallel browser settings, to ensure compatibility and reliability across different environments.

Automated Test Scripts: Develop automated test scripts using the framework to validate various modules of Carwale.com, including registration and other key functionalities.

Data-Driven Approach: Utilize a data-driven approach to automate test cases, enabling the execution of multiple test scenarios with different input data.

Allure Reports: Generate Allure reports to provide comprehensive test result analysis, including detailed test execution reports, graphical representations, and statistics.

Integration with GitHub and Jenkins: Upload the project to your GitHub repository, commit changes regularly, and leverage Jenkins for automated builds and test runs.

### Outcome: Successfully developed a Selenium hybrid framework for automating carwale.com website and added test scripts to login and other modules using a data-driven approach and Pytest framework. So as this is a complete framework, adding new test scripts is more straightforward.
